GridN_Atom	-> [atomnum+1]
	the number of grids overlaping to each atom

GcAN 


M2G	M2G[Matomnum+1]
	M2G gives a conversion from the medium
	index to the global indicies of atoms.

Matomnum
	Total number of atom in medium

 int **natn;
	grobal index number of neighboring atoms of an atom ct_AN
	size: natn[atomnum+1][Max_FSNAN*ScaleSize+1]
	allocation: call as Allocate_Arrays(3) in truncation.c

ncn = neighboring cell 

int *FNAN;
	the number of first neighboring atoms
	 size: FNAN[atomnum+1]

Density_Grid_B_Atom[i][j][k]
    i = atomnum, 1~atomnum
    j = spin idx, 0,1
    k = grid
